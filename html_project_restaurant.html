            <strong>Cupcake</strong><br><br>
            <img width="105" height="80" src="https://sugargeekshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/vanilla_cupcake_featured_blog.jpg" alt="imag">
            <p>A cupcake is a tiny cake that is baked in a thin paper mold or an aluminum cup. <br>
                One cupcake should typically serve one person. <br>
                 The first mention of a cupcake can be traced back to a 1796 cookbook called American Cookery <br>
                  written by Amelia Simmons.
               Her recipe stated that a cake is to be baked in small cups. <br>
                The term cupcake has first been used in 1828 in Eliza Leslie's Receipts cookbook. <br>
                 Over the years, cupcakes have become a huge industry <br>
                  and the name cupcake is now given to any small cake that is about the size of a cup. <br>
               Their popularity is probably owed to the fact that they bake much quicker than larger cakes. <br>
                Chocolate and vanilla are still the classic flavors, while new ones such as raspberry meringue <br>
                 and espresso fudge can also be found in numerous bakeries and cupcakes shops around the world.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gaufre</strong><br><br>

            <p>Delicious and fragrant waffles are the most famous Belgian culinary trademark. <br>
                 Made with thick dough or thin batter, the cakes are baked in a specially designed waffle <br>
                  iron which creates an unusual checkered pattern on the top and bottom of each cake.</p>
